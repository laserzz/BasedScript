# BasedScript

A WIP Toy Language written in Rust.

### Install Instructions

To use, clone the repo and install the [Rust Compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\
Next, compile the interpreter with `rustc main.rs` (make sure you have navigated to the correct directory)\
After that, run `./main ./examples/main.txt` and watch the magic happen! Feel free to change things around and see what works.
